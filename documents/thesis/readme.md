Uses rubber version 1.4. Also texlive-full and biber. 
Note (2016-06-10): biber has a problem with biblatex, a fix has been suggested here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/biber/+bug/1565842

Requires python-pygments for the latex minted package.

Use vim with marked folding to read the texfile.

# Personal note
When exporting sources from Zotero use Bibtex and western encoding.
