\chapter{Introduction}

Since 
the conception of neuroscience the neurons function have been studied on many levels
from the properties of the cell membrane to clustered networks of neurons.


There are several types of neurons 
and it was early noticed that different kind of neurons gave different
types of signals. 

This was of much interest because 


% The problem
% While doing single cell recordings the only information
% about the neuron that is avaiable is the electric signal from the neuron.
Modern types of 
classification uses genotype?, the structure of the neuron and the 
electric signal.

It is useful to seperate interneurons from pyramidal neurons as
pyramidal neurons are excitatory and interneurons are inhibitory. 

Is it possible to seperate interneurons from pyramidal neurons soly
based on the shape of the action potental. 

Knowing the neuron type is important for research. 
While doing single cell recordings on alive subjects the researchers are
recording in the dark. 
The electrodes only pick up on electrical signals from the brain, 
so the researcher does not know exactly what they cell they are recording. 

Surely the different types of neurons are specialized at certain functions

In this article we show that interneurons can be seperated from pyramidal
neurons based on data and models from the Blue Brain project. 
The program makes an easy way to do the same analysis
on future models as long as the models can be loaded with LFPy.

%{{{ The Neuron
\section{The Neuron}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[angle=-90,width=1.0\textwidth]{images/2_1/neuron_structure.pdf}
    \caption{Stuff about this neuron.}
    \label{fig:2_1_neuron}
\end{figure}
\noindent
{Neurons} 
are electrically excitiable cells
that are a fundamental part of all brain functions.
Other names include {nerve cells}, {neurone} or more 
colloquially {brain cells}.
Neurons form in big networks 
which process information,
and in the human brain there is an estimated $10^{11}$ neurons.

Special proteins in the cell membrane enables the neuron to
fire action potentials when it is electrically excited. 
These action potentials are sharp voltage changes that propagates through
the full structure of the neuron. 
The same properties that makes the neuron able to fire makes 
the action potential {regenerative}, meaning it will propagate
without decay.

The body of the neuron, the {soma}, has {dendrites} and 
the {axon} attached to it. 
The dendrites and the axon are very thin branching structures 
with a width usually in the order of \SI{1}{\micro\metre}. 
While neurons often have many dendrites directly attached to the soma
there is only one axon attached through the \emph{axon hillock}.
The axon can branch several times before it ends and 
usually connects to the dendrites of other neurons via synapes.

The synapes are electrically sensitive which allows information
to pass between neurons. 
Though the majority of all synapes are axo-dendritic 
(axon to dendrite),
other junctions are also possible.
Other junctions include but are not limited to,
dendrite to dendrite, 
axon to axon and 
axon to blood vessel. 
When an action potential reaches a synapse it will activate
the synapse and pass information to the connect neuron. 
The information that is passed along depends on the type of synapse,
and if it is of a chemical or electrical type.

% Neuron cell types, pyramidal neurons, basket neurons interneurons, what 
% are they. The term "morphology". Intracellular also referred to as membrane potential.

%{{{ Electrical Activity
\section{Electrical Activity}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[angle=-90,width=1.0\textwidth]{images/2_1/ion_pumps_0.pdf}
    \caption{Something about ion pumps and channels.}
    \label{fig:2_1_ion_channels}
\end{figure}
The potential difference between the inside and outside the neurons 
are caused by different concentrations of 
ions
in the extracellular and intracellular medium. 
The ions cannot pass through 
the cell membrane as it
consists of a \SI{5}{\nano\metre} lipid bilayer which is mostly impenetrable 
to ions. 

In the membrane sits differnt \emph{ion channels} and 
\emph{ion pumps} which can have selective permeability to ions, this creates 
a potential gradient across the membrane. 
The most significant ions in this process are Sodium (Na$^+$), Potassium (K$^+$), 
Calcium (Ca$^{2+}$), Magnecium (Mg$^{2+}$) and Chloride (Cl$^{-}$). 
Ion channels are divided between passive channels and 
active channels where the active channels can change 
permeability under certain conditions while passive channels have a constant
permeability. 

The ion pumps differ from the channels by activly transporting certain
ions through the membrane. 
For instance, the Sodium-Pottasium exchanger pushes two K$^+$ ions out of the cell
for every three Na$^+$ it pushes into the cell. Doing this creates a net 
loss of charge inside the cell and the pump is therefore electrogenic. 
Not all pumps are electrogenic, the Sodium-Hydrogen exchanger transports
H$^+$ and Na$^+$ without effecting the net charge.
For each H$^+$ ion out of the cell the pump pushes one Na$^+$
into the cell. 

To understand the electrical activity of neurons it is useful
to view the neuron as an electronic circuit where the ion channels, ion pumps
and the membrane serve as different electronic components.

%{{{ Action Potential
\section{Action Potential}
Action potentials are sharp increases in the membrane potential
followed by a less sharp decrease towards the resting potential. 
In the the depolarization phase the potential rises towards the peak magnitude, 
while in the repolarization phase the potential decreases towards
the cells resting potential.
When the potental is below the resting potential 
it reaches the afterhyperpolarization phase before
it returns to its resting potential.

%{{{ Extracellular
\section{Calculating Extracellular Potential}
The extracellular potential is the electric potential generated from the transmembrane
currents in the neurons. When a neuron fires this can be seen from the extracellular
potential which will have a spike which is similar to the intracellular spike.

By modelling the neuron as
compartments and approximating each compartment as
a spherical volume current source at position $\bf r_0$, the potential at 
at position $\bf r$ at time $t$ will be,
\begin{align}
    {\bf E(r, t)} = \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma}\frac{I_0(t)}{\abs{\bf r - r_0}}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    {\bf E(r, t)} = \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma}\frac{I_n(t)}{\abs{\bf r - r_0}}
\end{align}

Potential from compartments modelled as line sources. 
\begin{align}
    {\bf E(r, t)} &= \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma}\sum^N_{n=1}I_n(t)\frac{dr_n}{\abs{\bf r - r_0}}\\
    &= \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma}\sum^N_{n=1}I_n(t)
        \frac{1}{\Delta s_n}
        \log\abs{\frac{\sqrt{h_n^2 + \rho_n^2} - h_n}{\sqrt{l_n^2 + \rho_n^2} - l_n}}
\end{align}
Taken from \textcite{linden_lfpy:_2013}


This equation rests on two assumptions,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The permeability $\mu $ of 
	the extracellular medium is the same as that of vacuum $\mu_0$.
	\item The quasistatic approximation which lets the 
	time derivatives, $\partial E/\partial t$, 
	be ignored as source terms.  See \cref{sec:quasi}
\end{enumerate}

The extracellular potential can be calculated
using Maxwell's equations and the continuity equation if the spatial
distribution (morphology) of transmembrane currents and the extracellular conductivity
is known. 



In the quasistatic approximation, since $\nabla\times\bf E = 0$, the
electric field can be expressed with a scalar potential.

Forward problem = calculate the potential from the current source, inverse problem is used
in magnetoenchephalography (important).
The amplitude of a spike in the
extracellular potential is usually in the magnintude of
$< 200 \upmu$V.  
The noise of electrodes vary, but can be as much as $20 \upmu$V. 
This limits the range electrodes can record from. 

The currents sum to zero, while the spike is very visible, there are many small currents
in the dendrites with opposite current. 
(\cite{hamalainen_magnetoencephalography-_1993})

The extracellular spike width tend to increase with distance from soma because of the
neuronal morphology. 
This article used a passive neuron model with different morphologies to show
that the spike width increases with distance to soma. The spike amplitude also
decreases with distance to soma and seems to follow a power law. 
(\cite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} \hspace{-3pt}).

The shape of extracellular spikes are mainly depedent on the membrane currents
and the morphology of the cell. 
Some of the effects from the morphology of the cell are increased spike width and
decreased amplitude from distance to soma. 

Many things here from around page 245. 
When the conductivity $\sigma$ and the current generators are know, Maxwell's
equations and the continuity equation equation can be used to calculate the electric
field $E$ and magnetic field $B$. (TODO: Copied text)
(\cite{hamalainen_magnetoencephalography-_1993})

\subsection*{Background}
% Electric potential from neurons can either be obtained 
% by measuring the membrane potential or measured from the extracellular
% medium. 
%Recording the membrane potential is easier to interpret but harder to execute 
%while 
%extracellular recordings are harder to interpret but easier to execute. 
Recording is usually done using electrodes, this makes recording the membrane potential
more challenging than recording from the extracellular medium as the electrode
has to be very close or inside the cell. 
At the time of writing,
recording the membrane potential of a concious subject is nearly impossible,
this makes understanding extracellular potentials vital for current research. 


Early calculations was done by Rall 1962 investigating 
the interaction between action potentials and synapes using cylinders
as the current source. (TODO: Read article, make more understandble.)
Holt and Koch 1999 added comparmental models to reconstruct pyramidal neurons. 

The information about the transmembrane current is usually difficult to obtain,
as well as the morphology.

% Spike Width Measurement {{{ %
\section{Spike Width Measurement}
% TODO: Include sources to different ways of defining spike width.
Many different definitions of spike width has been used to differentiate neurons, but
to date it is not clear which definition is best suited for neuron classification. 

Most extracellular spikeshapes has a minimum value greater than the maximum 
value,
but this is not always the case when measuring
far away from soma. 
\\

\noindent 
Width Type I - Peak-to-peak: 

Width is measured as the time from the minimum potential to the maximum. 
This is the time from the polarization phase to the afterhyperpolarization phase. 
\newline

\noindent
Width Type II - Width at Half Amplitude:

Width is measured as the duration the spike is below half amplitude of the signal measured
from the baseline at the start of the signal. 
\newline

\noindent
Width Type II - Width at Half Amplitude:

Width is measured as the duration the spike is below half amplitude of the signal measured
from the baseline at the start of the signal. 
\newline

There are three prevailant ways of defining spike width which 
has been named Type I, Type II and Type III.

\textbf{Type I}: 
Width is measured from "peak-to-peak". 
This method can easily be implemented by measuring the width from
minimum to maximum value.
In the cases where the spike is flipped or is not well defined, this
definition is not correct.

As such the implementation of this definition was done by measuring
the time from the the maximum absolute value to the preceding maximal absolute
value on the opposing side.

% Simulations with LFPyUtil{{{ 
\section{Simulations with LFPyUtil}
LFPyUtil is a python package that was created for this project with the purpose
to simplify the simulation pipeline for multiple neurons and creating
and easy to use interface when developing new simulations. 
LFPyUtil extends and uses the package LFPy to accomplish this. 

The main feature of the python package LFPy is enable the calculation
of extracellular potentials, but another major feature is the simplification
of simulations with the simulation engine Neuron. 
Using Neuron requires a good understanding of the programming language hoc
which creates many challanges as hoc is outdated and is no longer
maintained by the developers. 
To use Neuron with python one has to use the python interface to Neuron
which has been implemented in such a way that runs hoc code directly 
"under the hood". 
A common situation is that one must write hoc code inside strings and
pass them to the python-hoc interpreter. 
This has the unfortunate consequence that the two programming langues are
very intertwined 
and also does not follow
common python coding conventions. 
This also makes it harder for users to troubleshoot errors as problems can
occur either in python, hoc or between the two.
To solve this the package LFPy has attempted to wrap the cell model and
electrodes from the Neuron engine into python objects, such as the 
{\verb LFPy.Cell } and 
{\verb LFPy.StimIntElectrode } classes.

When running a simulation with Neuron there is no inherent support for 
running simulations simultaniously. 
Because LFPy is an extension to Neuron this is also lacking in LFPy. 
LFPyUtil attempts to solve this by starting each simulation
in independent processes. This does not speed up a single simulation
but rather speeds up the simulation of multiple neurons and simulations
that must be run multiple times with different parameters.
The major difficulties of running independent processes with
Neuron is 
that there is no reset function which can make 
the state of the previous simulation effect the state of the next
simulation. 


% TODO: Include sources to the number 0.3 conductivity.
In all simulations the extracellular conductivity was set to 
$\sigma = \SI{0.3}{\ohm\metre}$
based upon data from experimental measurements. 

All stimulus electrodes uses the {\verb LFPy.StimIntElectrode } with 
a custom made electrode named ISyn. With the default stimulus all transmembrane 
currents will be summed
equal the input current, using ISyn prevents this and the currents are correctly
summed to $0$.

The following items are python objects in LFPyUtil.
\newline

SphereRand
\newline
\noindent
SphereRand places
electrodes placed in uniformly distributied locations 
around the soma within a default radius of \SI{50}{\micro\metre}. 
Spike timing is detected by thresholding the soma membrane potential.
That timing is applied to all electrodes such that all electrodes measure
the same part of the simulation. 
If the signal has several spikes
the spike index must be supplied, the default setting uses the first spike.

To verify that the simulation environment could be trusted 
some results from 
\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} was replicated.
Spesifically the spike width and amplitude dependency in relation to 
the distance from soma was compared to current results. 

\subsection{Simulation}
\textbf{Cell:}
The \textcite{mainen_influence_1996} morphology was used with a passive model, which is 
the same model used in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}. 
The cell was rotated using PCA (principal component analysis) on the compartment
positions.
This calculates three orthogonal vectors such that 
the positions of the compartments 
has the greatest variance along the first principal component, 
second highest along the second and third most along the third.
The first principal component was made paralell to the y-axis which
puts the apical dendrites along this axis
(\cref{fig:4_1_morph}).

\noindent
\textbf{Spike Generation:}
An action potental was generated using the Connor-Stevens model 
(\textcite{connor_prediction_1971,connor_neural_1977})
using the same parameters as \textcite{dayan_theoretical_2001}\@. 
In \cref{fig:4_1_cs_ap_signal} the Connor-Stevens simulation is shown
where the second spike was used for further analysis. 
This spike had an amplitude of \SI{119.49}{\milli\volt} from baseline. 
The baseline was estimated to \SI{-53.26}{\milli\volt} and the
peak at \SI{53.26}{\milli\volt}. 
These values matches \textcite{dayan_theoretical_2001}\@, but not
the spike used in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} which had an amplitude of 
\SI{83}{\milli\volt} from baseline. 
\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} does not go into further detail about
the creation of the action potential other than stating that the action 
potential used were similar to \textcite{dayan_theoretical_2001}\@.
The difference can be explained by the fact that action potentials
from pyramidal neurons often peaks at \SI{20}{\milli\volt},
and that this was achived by scaling the original signal from the
Connor-Stevens model.
To compensate for the difference the action potental used in further 
simulations were 
scaled to \SI{83}{\milli\volt} (\cref{fig:4_1_cs_ap_scaled}).

The input current was set to 
\SI{12.6}{\micro\ampere\per\centi\metre\squared}. 
and was very carefully adjusted to make the magnitude spectrum 
(\cref{fig:4_1_fourier})
similar to 
\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}\@ figure 3.
Without adjustment the magnitude spectrum tended to have
a different inital value, from $6$ to \SI{8}{\milli\volt}, and
was not as smooth.

            \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}.

\textbf{Parameters:}
Parameters for the Neuron simulation were the same as used in 
\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} and the action potential used as a boundary
condition in the soma is the one specified above. 
Membrane resistance 
$R_m = \SI{30}{\kilo\ohm\per\centi\metre\squared}$, 
membrane capacitance 
$C_m=\SI{1}{\micro\farad\per\centi\metre\squared}$, 
axial resistance 
$R_a = \SI{150}{\ohm\per\centi\metre\squared}$, 
time resolution 
$dt = \SI[exponent-base=2]{e-5}{\milli\second}$. 
The reversal potential was set to zero. The action potental was imposed in all
soma sections using the "play" vector function in Neuron.

        \vspace{-10pt}
    \end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}
\noindent
\textbf{Electrode Positions:}
Recording sites were placed in the xz plane at 11 linearly spaced 
positions along 36 lines with equal 
angular spacing (\cref{fig:4_1_electrode_pos}).
\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} states the recording positions
were in the plane perpendicular to the apical dendrites, this is 
ensured by the rotation done with PCA and putting the electrodes in
the xz-plane.
\\


\noindent
\textbf{Spike Width \& Amplitude:}
A baseline was set as the value at the start of the signal. 
Amplitude was calculated as the difference between the maximum value and the
baseline.
The spike width was calculated at as the width at half maximum value. 

At 
$dt = \SI[exponent-base=2]{e-5}{\milli\second} = \SI{0.03125}{\milli\second}$,
the spike width from the Connor-Steven model was 
\SI{0.5625}{\milli\volt}.
This is similar to the reported spike width from 
\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}
which was \SI{0.55}{\milli\second} and must have been rounded to
the nearest \SI{0.05}{\milli\second}.

\subsection{Results}
The action potental that was used in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} 
is similar to the one used here.  The amplitude of the fourier transform is displayed in
\cref{fig:4_1_fourier}, which is in close resemblance to the action potential
in fig. $3$ in the paper.

\caption{Magnitude specter of simulated somatic membrane potential.}
\label{fig:4_1_fourier}
\end{figure}

The spike width increases with the distance from soma as seen in 
\cref{fig:4_1_spike_width}. These results are 
lower than the widths reported in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}.
(Use more time on editing the Connor-Stevens model to come closer to 
an max.amplitude on 20mV?).   

Sudden changes in spike width was experienced with increased distance from
soma. Above $200\mu V$ the
spikes shapes are not well defined. 
This was also reported in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}.\\

\label{fig:4_1_spike_width}
\end{figure}

\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} reports a spike amplitude above $150\mu V$ at 
$20\mu m$, this does not match current findings.  
\cref{fig:4_1_spike_amp} shows spike amplitude with logarithmic axes.  
(TODO: Is numbers on the power law decays necessaryy?) Although 
the data does not match \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}, 
it is comparable with what is
expected in the near and far limit field of a ball and stick neuron.
In the near field the the expectation is a $1/r$ decay and in the far field
it is  $1/r^2$ or $1/r^3$ depending on distance. (TODO: Clearify this, put reference
back to theory chapter.)

% {{{ Optimal Spike Width%
\section{Optimal Spike Width Definition}
Spike width has been used to classify inhibitory neurons from excitatory neurons. 
But in the literature there has been many different definitions of spike widths
which makes comparing results across reseach difficult.

Measurements was done using the three different spike width definitions
and in relation to distance from soma. 
A good definition is recoqnized by having a good seperation between inhibitory
neurons and excitatory neurons.

Blue brain reconstruced neurons and indentified 55 types of 
morphological structures. 
Inhibitory neurons were distinguished by axonal features
and excitatory types by dendritic features. 

Excitatory neurons represented above $87\%$ of all neurons.

50 \% of all inhibitory interneurons are baskets cells (LBC and NBC),

% \section{Quasistatic Approximation in Neural Tissue}
% \label{sec:quasi}
% A quasistatic approximation implies that the equations have a form that does
% not include time derivatives (static). Some quantaties can be allowed to vary over 
% time, but slowly. 
% 	Here we show that the quasistatic approximation is a valid assumption in
% neural tissue. First start with Maxwell's equations.
% \begin{align}
% 	\nabla \cdot {\bf E} &= p / e \nonumber\\
% 	\nabla \times {\bf E} &= -\partial \bf{B} / \partial t \label{eq:max_1}\\
% 	\nabla \cdot {\bf B} &= 0\nonumber\\
% 	\nabla \times {\bf B} &= \mu_0({\bf J} + \epsilon_0\partial{\bf E}/\partial t)
% 	\label{eq:max_3}
% \end{align}

% In a passive nonmagnetic medium, {\bf J} is the sum of ohmic volume current 
% and the polarization current
% \begin{align}
% 	\bf J &= \sigma{\bf E} + \partial {\bf P}/\partial t \label{eq:cur_den_0}
% \end{align}
% where ${\bf P} = (\epsilon - \epsilon_0){\bf E}$ is the polarization and $\epsilon$
% is the permitivity of the material.In neuromagnetism, we generally deal with
% frequencies that are below 100 \si{\hertz}. Cellular electrical
% phenomena contain mostly frequencies below \si{1\kilo\hertz}. 
% Let $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ be uniform and let us consider elctromagnetic 
% wave at frequencty $f$.
% \begin{align}
% 	{\bf E} = {\bf E}_0({\bf r})\exp(i2\pi ft)
% \end{align}
% With \cref{eq:max_3,eq:cur_den_0} we get,
% \begin{align}
% 	\nabla \times {\bf B} &= \mu_0(
% 		\sigma{\bf E} + 
% 		(\epsilon - \epsilon_0)\partial{\bf E}/\partial t + 
% 		\epsilon_0\partial{\bf E}/\partial t
% 		)
% \end{align}
% For the quasistatic approximation to be valid, it is necessary
% that the time-derivative terms be small compared to the 
% ohmic current. 
% \begin{align}
% 	\abs{\epsilon{\bf E}/\partial t} \ll \abs{\bf \sigma E} 
% 		\rightarrow 2\pi f \epsilon/\sigma \ll 1
% \end{align}
% With $\sigma = 0.3\,\si{\per\ohm\per\meter}$, the value of brain tissue, 
% $\epsilon = 10^5\cdot\epsilon_0$, and $f = 100\,\si{\hertz}$, we find
% \begin{align}
% 	2\pi f\epsilon/\sigma = 2\cdot10^{-3} \ll 1
% \end{align}
% In addition, $\partial {\bf B} /\partial t$ must be small. from
% \cref{eq:max_1,eq:max_3}, 
% \begin{align}
% 	\nabla\times\nabla\times{\bf E} &= 
% 		-\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla\times{\bf B})\nonumber\\
% 	&= -\mu_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}
% 		(
% 		\sigma{\bf E} + \epsilon\partial{\bf E}/\partial t
% 		) \nonumber \\
% 	&= -i2\pi f\mu_0(\sigma + i2\pi f\epsilon){\bf E}
% \end{align}

% Solutions of this equation have spatial changes on the characteristic
% length scale
% \begin{align}
% 	\lambda_c = \abs{2\pi f \mu_0 \sigma(1+i2\pi f \epsilon/\sigma)}^{-1/2}
% 		\approx65\,\si{\meter}
% \end{align}
% This length is much longer than the diameter of the head. This implies that the
% contribution of $\partial {\bf B}/\partial t$ to $\bf E$ is small. Theautorefor,
% the quaasistatic approximation appears justified. This does not
% mean that we should forget time-dependent phenomena altogether. 
% For example, the capacitative current through the cell membrane is significant in
% determining the properties of the action potential. 
% Nevertheless, this so-called displacement current, 
% $\epsilon_0\partial{\bf E}/\partial t$, need not be taken into account in the 
% calculation of $\bf B$.
