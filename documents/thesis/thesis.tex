\section{The Neuron}
\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Stuff about this neuron.}
    \label{fig:2_1_neuron}
\end{figure}
\noindent
\emph{Neurons} 
are electrically excitiable cells
that are a fundamental part of all brain functions.
Other names include \emph{nerve cells}, \emph{neurone} or more 
colloquially \emph{brain cells}.
Neurons form in big networks 
which process information,
and in the human brain there is an estimated $10^{11}$ neurons.

Special proteins in the cell membrane enables the neuron to
fire action potentials when it is electrically excited. 
These action potentials are sharp voltage changes that propagates through
the full structure of the neuron. 
The same properties that makes the neuron able to fire makes 
the action potential \emph{regenerative}, meaning it will propagate
without decay.

The body of the neuron, the \emph{soma}, has \emph{dendrites} and 
the \emph{axon} attached to it. 
The dendrites and the axon are very thin branching structures 
with a width usually in the order of \SI{1}{\micro\metre}. 
While neurons often have many dendrites directly attached to the soma
there is only one axon attached through the \emph{axon hillock}.
The axon can branch several times before it ends and 
usually connects to the dendrites of other neurons via synapes.

The synapes are electrically sensitive which allows information
to pass between neurons. 
Though the majority of all synapes are axo-dendritic 
(axon to dendrite),
other junctions are also possible.
Other junctions include but are not limited to,
dendrite to dendrite, 
axon to axon and 
axon to blood vessel. 
When an action potential reaches a synapse it will activate
the synapse and pass information to the connect neuron. 
The information that is passed along depends on the type of synapse,
and if it is of a chemical or electrical type.

% Neuron cell types, pyramidal neurons, basket neurons interneurons, what 
% are they. The term "morphology". Intracellular also referred to as membrane potential.

%{{{ Electrical Activity
\section{Electrical Activity}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[angle=-90,width=1.0\textwidth]{images/2_1/ion_pumps_0.pdf}
    \caption{Something about ion pumps and channels.}
    \label{fig:2_1_ion_channels}
\end{figure}
The potential difference between the inside and outside the neurons 
are caused by different concentrations of 
ions
in the extracellular and intracellular medium. 
The ions cannot pass through 
the cell membrane as it
consists of a \SI{5}{\nano\metre} lipid bilayer which is mostly impenetrable 
to ions. 

In the membrane sits differnt \emph{ion channels} and 
\emph{ion pumps} which can have selective permeability to ions, this creates 
a potential gradient across the membrane. 
The most significant ions in this process are Sodium (Na$^+$), Potassium (K$^+$), 
Calcium (Ca$^{2+}$), Magnecium (Mg$^{2+}$) and Chloride (Cl$^{-}$). 
Ion channels are divided between passive channels and 
active channels where the active channels can change 
permeability under certain conditions while passive channels have a constant
permeability. 

The ion pumps differ from the channels by activly transporting certain
ions through the membrane. 
For instance, the Sodium-Pottasium exchanger pushes two K$^+$ ions out of the cell
for every three Na$^+$ it pushes into the cell. Doing this creates a net 
loss of charge inside the cell and the pump is therefore electrogenic. 
Not all pumps are electrogenic, the Sodium-Hydrogen exchanger transports
H$^+$ and Na$^+$ without effecting the net charge.
For each H$^+$ ion out of the cell the pump pushes one Na$^+$
into the cell. 

To understand the electrical activity of neurons it is useful
to view the neuron as an electronic circuit where the ion channels, ion pumps
and the membrane serve as different electronic components.

%{{{ Action Potential
\section{Action Potential}
Action potentials are sharp increases in the membrane potential
followed by a less sharp decrease towards the resting potential. 
In the the depolarization phase the potential rises towards the peak magnitude, 
while in the repolarization phase the potential decreases towards
the cells resting potential.
When the potental is below the resting potential 
it reaches the afterhyperpolarization phase before
it returns to its resting potential.

%{{{ Extracellular
\section{Calculating Extracellular Potential}
The extracellular potential is the electric potential generated from the transmembrane
currents in the neurons. When a neuron fires this can be seen from the extracellular
potential which will have a spike which is similar to the intracellular spike.

By modelling the neuron as
compartments and approximating each compartment as
a spherical volume current source at position $\bf r_0$, the potential at 
at position $\bf r$ at time $t$ will be,
\begin{align}
    {\bf E(r, t)} = \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma}\frac{I_0(t)}{\abs{\bf r - r_0}}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    {\bf E(r, t)} = \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma}\frac{I_n(t)}{\abs{\bf r - r_0}}
\end{align}

Potential from compartments modelled as line sources. 
\begin{align}
    {\bf E(r, t)} &= \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma}\sum^N_{n=1}I_n(t)\frac{dr_n}{\abs{\bf r - r_0}}\\
    &= \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma}\sum^N_{n=1}I_n(t)
        \frac{1}{\Delta s_n}
        \log\abs{\frac{\sqrt{h_n^2 + \rho_n^2} - h_n}{\sqrt{l_n^2 + \rho_n^2} - l_n}}
\end{align}
Taken from \textcite{linden_lfpy:_2013}


This equation rests on two assumptions,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The permeability $\mu $ of 
	the extracellular medium is the same as that of vacuum $\mu_0$.
	\item The quasistatic approximation which lets the 
	time derivatives, $\partial E/\partial t$, 
	be ignored as source terms.  See \cref{sec:quasi}
\end{enumerate}

The extracellular potential can be calculated
using Maxwell's equations and the continuity equation if the spatial
distribution (morphology) of transmembrane currents and the extracellular conductivity
is known. 



In the quasistatic approximation, since $\nabla\times\bf E = 0$, the
electric field can be expressed with a scalar potential.

Forward problem = calculate the potential from the current source, inverse problem is used
in magnetoenchephalography (important).
The amplitude of a spike in the
extracellular potential is usually in the magnintude of
$< 200 \upmu$V.  
The noise of electrodes vary, but can be as much as $20 \upmu$V. 
This limits the range electrodes can record from. 

The currents sum to zero, while the spike is very visible, there are many small currents
in the dendrites with opposite current. 
(\cite{hamalainen_magnetoencephalography-_1993})

The extracellular spike width tend to increase with distance from soma because of the
neuronal morphology. 
This article used a passive neuron model with different morphologies to show
that the spike width increases with distance to soma. The spike amplitude also
decreases with distance to soma and seems to follow a power law. 
(\cite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} \hspace{-3pt}).

The shape of extracellular spikes are mainly depedent on the membrane currents
and the morphology of the cell. 
Some of the effects from the morphology of the cell are increased spike width and
decreased amplitude from distance to soma. 

Many things here from around page 245. 
When the conductivity $\sigma$ and the current generators are know, Maxwell's
equations and the continuity equation equation can be used to calculate the electric
field $E$ and magnetic field $B$. (TODO: Copied text)
(\cite{hamalainen_magnetoencephalography-_1993})

\subsection*{Background}
% Electric potential from neurons can either be obtained 
% by measuring the membrane potential or measured from the extracellular
% medium. 
%Recording the membrane potential is easier to interpret but harder to execute 
%while 
%extracellular recordings are harder to interpret but easier to execute. 
Recording is usually done using electrodes, this makes recording the membrane potential
more challenging than recording from the extracellular medium as the electrode
has to be very close or inside the cell. 
At the time of writing,
recording the membrane potential of a concious subject is nearly impossible,
this makes understanding extracellular potentials vital for current research. 


Early calculations was done by Rall 1962 investigating 
the interaction between action potentials and synapes using cylinders
as the current source. (TODO: Read article, make more understandble.)
Holt and Koch 1999 added comparmental models to reconstruct pyramidal neurons. 

The information about the transmembrane current is usually difficult to obtain,
as well as the morphology.

\section{Pettersen \& Einevoll (2008) Reproduction}
To verify that the simulation environment could be trusted 
some results from 
\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} was replicated.
Spesifically the spike width and amplitude dependency in relation to 
the distance from soma was compared to current results. 

% Write more about the connor stevens model?

\subsection{Simulation}
\emph{Cell:}
The \textcite{mainen_influence_1996} cell was used with a passive model, which is 
the same model used in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}. 
It is not clear in which plane the measurements was taken from so 
the cell was rotated using PCA (principal component analysis) on the compartment
positions.
This rotates the cell so most of the dendrites are along
the y and x-axis. 
\\
% TODO: show the morphology of the neuron

\noindent\emph{Spike Generation:}
An action potental was generated using the Connor-Stevens model 
\cites{connor_prediction_1971, connor_neural_1977}
using the same parameters as \textcite{dayan_theoretical_2001}. 
This had an amplitude of $107.6mV$ from baseline with the peak at $48.21mV$. 
These values are similar (TODO: how similar?) to \textcite{dayan_theoretical_2001}, but not
with \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} which had an amplitude of 
$83mV$ from baseline. To compensate for the difference the action potental was 
normalized to $83mV$ manually (\cref{fig:3_1_soma_mem}).
\\

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/3_methods/3_1_reproduction/soma_mem.pdf}
\caption{Soma membrane voltage. }
\label{fig:3_1_soma_mem}
\end{figure}


\noindent\emph{Parameters:}
Parameters are the same as \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} and 
\textcite{dayan_theoretical_2001} . Membrane resistance 
$R_m = 3\cdot10^4\Omega /cm^2$, membrane capacitance $C_m=1\mu F / cm^2$, 
axial resistance $R_a = 150\Omega/cm^2$, time resolution $dt=2^{-6}ms$. 
The reversal potential was set to zero. The action potental was imposed in all
soma sections using the "play" vector function in Neuron.
\\

\noindent\emph{Electrode Positions:}
Recording sites were placed in the xz plane at 11 linearly spaced 
positions along 36 lines with equal 
angular spacing. (TODO: Show the electrode positions.) 
\\


\noindent\emph{Spike Width \& Amplitude:}
A baseline was set as the value at the start of the signal. 
Amplitude was calculated as the difference between maximum absolute value and the
baseline.
The spike width was calculated at half width at maximum amplitude. 

Spike width was recorded at $0.5625 ms$ for $dt=2\cdot10^{-5}$, similar to 
$0.55ms$ from \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}. When increasing the
resolution to $dt=2\cdot10^{-6}ms$ the spike width rose to $0.625ms$. 


\subsection{Results}
The action potental that was used in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} 
is similar to the one used here.  The amplitude of the fourier transform is displayed in
\cref{fig:3_1_fourier}, which is in close resemblance to the standard action potential
in Fig. $3$ in the paper.

The spike width increases with the distance from soma as seen in 
\cref{fig:3_1_spike_width}. These results are 
lower than the widths reported in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}.
(Use more time on editing the Connor-Stevens model to come closer to 
an max.amplitude on 20mV?).   

Sudden changes in spike width was experienced with increased distance from
soma. Above $200\mu V$ the
spikes shapes are not well defined. 
This was also reported in \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}.\\

\textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008} reports a spike amplitude above $150\mu V$ at 
$20\mu m$, this does not match current findings.  
\cref{fig:3_1_spike_amp} shows spike amplitude with logarithmic axes.  
(TODO: Is numbers on the power law decays necessaryy?) Although 
the data does not match \textcite{pettersen_amplitude_2008}, 
it is comparable with what is
expected in the near and far limit field of a ball and stick neuron.
In the near field the the expectation is a $1/r$ decay and in the far field
it is  $1/r^2$ or $1/r^3$ depending on distance. (TODO: Clearify this, put reference
back to theory chapter.)

\section{Quasistatic Approximation in Neural Tissue}
\label{sec:quasi}
A quasistatic approximation implies that the equations have a form that does
not include time derivatives (static). Some quantaties can be allowed to vary over 
time, but slowly. 
	Here we show that the quasistatic approximation is a valid assumption in
neural tissue. First start with Maxwell's equations.
\begin{align}
	\nabla \cdot {\bf E} &= p / e \nonumber\\
	\nabla \times {\bf E} &= -\partial \bf{B} / \partial t \label{eq:max_1}\\
	\nabla \cdot {\bf B} &= 0\nonumber\\
	\nabla \times {\bf B} &= \mu_0({\bf J} + \epsilon_0\partial{\bf E}/\partial t)
	\label{eq:max_3}
\end{align}

In a passive nonmagnetic medium, {\bf J} is the sum of ohmic volume current 
and the polarization current
\begin{align}
	\bf J &= \sigma{\bf E} + \partial {\bf P}/\partial t \label{eq:cur_den_0}
\end{align}
where ${\bf P} = (\epsilon - \epsilon_0){\bf E}$ is the polarization and $\epsilon$
is the permitivity of the material.In neuromagnetism, we generally deal with
frequencies that are below 100 \si{\hertz}. Cellular electrical
phenomena contain mostly frequencies below \si{1\kilo\hertz}. 
Let $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ be uniform and let us consider elctromagnetic 
wave at frequencty $f$.
\begin{align}
	{\bf E} = {\bf E}_0({\bf r})\exp(i2\pi ft)
\end{align}
With \cref{eq:max_3,eq:cur_den_0} we get,
\begin{align}
	\nabla \times {\bf B} &= \mu_0(
		\sigma{\bf E} + 
		(\epsilon - \epsilon_0)\partial{\bf E}/\partial t + 
		\epsilon_0\partial{\bf E}/\partial t
		)
\end{align}
For the quasistatic approximation to be valid, it is necessary
that the time-derivative terms be small compared to the 
ohmic current. 
\begin{align}
	\abs{\epsilon{\bf E}/\partial t} \ll \abs{\bf \sigma E} 
		\rightarrow 2\pi f \epsilon/\sigma \ll 1
\end{align}
With $\sigma = 0.3\,\si{\per\ohm\per\meter}$, the value of brain tissue, 
$\epsilon = 10^5\cdot\epsilon_0$, and $f = 100\,\si{\hertz}$, we find
\begin{align}
	2\pi f\epsilon/\sigma = 2\cdot10^{-3} \ll 1
\end{align}
In addition, $\partial {\bf B} /\partial t$ must be small. from
\cref{eq:max_1,eq:max_3}, 
\begin{align}
	\nabla\times\nabla\times{\bf E} &= 
		-\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla\times{\bf B})\nonumber\\
	&= -\mu_0\frac{\partial}{\partial t}
		(
		\sigma{\bf E} + \epsilon\partial{\bf E}/\partial t
		) \nonumber \\
	&= -i2\pi f\mu_0(\sigma + i2\pi f\epsilon){\bf E}
\end{align}

Solutions of this equation have spatial changes on the characteristic
length scale
\begin{align}
	\lambda_c = \abs{2\pi f \mu_0 \sigma(1+i2\pi f \epsilon/\sigma)}^{-1/2}
		\approx65\,\si{\meter}
\end{align}
This length is much longer than the diameter of the head. This implies that the
contribution of $\partial {\bf B}/\partial t$ to $\bf E$ is small. Theautorefor,
the quaasistatic approximation appears justified. This does not
mean that we should forget time-dependent phenomena altogether. 
For example, the capacitative current through the cell membrane is significant in
determining the properties of the action potential. 
Nevertheless, this so-called displacement current, 
$\epsilon_0\partial{\bf E}/\partial t$, need not be taken into account in the 
calculation of $\bf B$.
