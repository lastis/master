	abstract = {Although extracellular unit recording is typically used for the detection of spike occurrences, it also has the theoretical ability to report about what are typically considered intracellular features of the action potential. We address this theoretical ability by developing a model system that captures features of experimentally recorded simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We use the line source approximation method of Holt and Koch to model the extracellular action potential (EAP) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulated with compartmental models. The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the EAPs, although it was difficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both the intracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggests that accounting for the EAP waveform provides a considerable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell. Interestingly, each cell's dendritic morphology had very little impact on the EAP waveform. The model also demonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currents in different cells is reflected in the features of the EAP.},

	abstract = {The Hodgkin-Huxley equations for space-clamped squid axon (18 degrees C) have been modified to approximate voltage clamp data from repetitive-firing crustacean walking leg axons and activity in response to constant current stimulation has been computed. The m infinity and h infinity parameters of the sodium conductance system were shifted along the voltage axis in opposite directions so that their relative overlap was increased approximately 7 mV. Time constants tau m and tau h, were moved in a similar manner. Voltage-dependent parameters of delayed potassium conductance, n infinity and tau n, were shifted 4.3 mV in the positive direction and tau n was uniformly increased by a factor of 2. Leakage conductance and capacitance were unchanged. Repetitive activity of this modified circuit was qualitatively similar to that of the standard model. A fifth branch was added to the circuit representing a transient potassium conductance system present in the repetitive walking leg axons and in other repetitive neurons. This model, with various parameter choices, fired repetitively down to approximately 2 spikes/s and up to 350/s. The frequency vs. stimulus current plot could be fit well by a straight line over a decade of the low frequency range and the general appearance of the spike trains was similar to that of other repetitive neurons. Stimulus intensities were of the same order as those which produce repetitive activity in the standard Hodgkin-Huxley axon. The repetitive firing rate and first spike latency (utilization time) were found to be most strongly influenced by the inactivation time constant of the transient potassium conductance (tau b), the delayed potassium conductance (tau n), and the value of leakage conductance (gL). The model presents a mechanism by which stable low frequency discharge can be generated by millisecond-order membrane conductance changes.},

	abstract = {Identifying and classifying action potential shapes in extracellular neural waveforms have long been the subject of research, and although several algorithms for this purpose have been successfully applied, their use has been limited by some outstanding problems. The first is how to determine shapes of the action potentials in the waveform and, second, how to decide how many shapes are distinct. A harder problem is that action potentials frequently overlap making difficult both the determination of the shapes and the classification of the spikes. In this report, a solution to each of these problems is obtained by applying Bayesian probability theory. By defining a probabilistic model of the waveform, the probability of both the form and number of spike shapes can be quantified. In addition, this framework is used to obtain an efficient algorithm for the decomposition of arbitrarily complex overlap sequences. This algorithm can extract many times more information than previous methods and facilitates the extracellular investigation of neuronal classes and of interactions within neuronal circuits.},

	abstract = {While extracellular somatic action potentials from freely moving rats have been well characterized, axonal activity has not. We report direct extracellular tetrode recordings of putative axons whose principal feature is a short duration waveform (SDW) with an average peak-trough length less than 179 $\mu$s. While SDW recordings using tetrodes have previously been treated as questionable or classified as cells, we hypothesize that they are representative of axonal activity. These waveforms have significantly shorter duration than somatic action potentials, are triphasic and are therefore similar to classic descriptions of microelectrode recordings in white matter and of in vitro action potential propagation along axons. We describe SDWs recorded from pure white-matter tracts including the alveus and corpus callosum. Recordings of several SDWs in the alveus exhibit grid-like firing patterns suggesting these axons carry spatial information from entorhinal cortical neurons. Finally, we locally injected the GABAA agonist Muscimol into layer CA1 of the hippocampus while simultaneously recording somatic activity and SDWs on the same tetrodes. The persistent activity of SDWs during Muscimol inactivation of somatic action potentials indicates that SDWs are representative of action potential propagation along axons projecting from more distal somata. This characterization is important as it illustrates the dangers of exclusively using spike duration as the sole determinant of unit type, particularly in the case of interneurons whose peak-trough times overlap with SDWs. It may also allow future studies to explore how axonal projections from disparate brain regions integrate spatial information in the hippocampus, and provide a basis for studying the effects of pharmaceutical agents on signal transmission in axons, and ultimately to aid in defining the potential role of axons in cognition.},

Here we show that individual layer 5 pyramidal neurons in acute slices from mouse primary motor cortex can adopt both regular and burst spiking patterns. During constant current injection at the soma, neurons displayed a regular firing pattern at 36{\textendash}37{\textdegree}C, but switched to burst spiking patterns upon cooling the slice to 24{\textendash}26{\textdegree}C. This change in firing pattern was reversible and repeatable and was independent of the somatic resting membrane potential. Hence these spiking patterns are not inherent to discrete populations of pyramidal neurons and are more interchangeable than previously thought. Burst spiking in these neurons is the result of electrical interactions between the soma and distal apical dendritic tree. Presumably the interactions between soma and distal dendrite are temperature-sensitive, suggesting that the manner in which layer 5 pyramidal neurons translate synaptic input into an output spiking pattern is fundamentally altered at sub-physiological temperatures.},

	abstract = {1. Physiological and morphological properties of layer V non-pyramidal and pyramidal cells in isolated slices of frontal cortex from young rats (16-22 days postnatal) were studied by whole-cell, current-clamp recording of visualized cell bodies coupled with intracellular staining by biocytin at 26-27 degrees C. 2. Plotting of spike width at half amplitude against input resistance revealed two physiological categories of nonpyramidal cells. One class (n = 29) had input resistances lower than 400 M omega and spike widths at half amplitude shorter than 0.8 ms; the other (n = 22) had input resistances higher than 400 M omega and spike widths longer than 0.8 ms. According to their spike firing characteristics, the former are called fast-spiking (FS) cells, and the latter low-threshold spike (LTS) cells. 3. Resting potentials were more negative in FS cells than in LTS cells. Membrane time constants in LTS cells were four times larger than those of FS cells. Afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) following action potentials consisted of a single component in FS cells, but two components with early and late peaks were observed in LTS cells. AHPs of FS cells had faster time-to-peak and larger amplitude than the early component of the AHPs of LTS cells. 4. Low-threshold spikes induced by depolarizing current pulses were observed at hyperpolarized potentials in LTS cells, but not in FS cells. The low-threshold spikes in LTS cells could be activated at hyperpolarized potentials by synaptic potentials. 5. Spike trains elicited by depolarizing current pulses in FS cells showed almost no spike-frequency adaptation, whereas those in LTS cells showed adaptation. 6. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of both groups of nonpyramidal cells contained N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated components. A combination of stimulation-induced EPSPs with depolarization caused repetitive firing in FS cells that was abolished by NMDA receptor blockers. Repetitive firing was not observed in LTS cells under these conditions. 7. The somal size of the two classes of nonpyramidal cells was similar. FS cells were all multipolar in shape, whereas LTS cells included both multipolar and bitufted types. The dendrites of some FS cells extended up into layers II/III, but there were also other FS cells with their dendrites restricted in layer V. Dendrites of LTS cells were mostly restricted to layer V. Dendrites of FS cells were mostly smooth, but those of LTS cells possessed a modest but consistent population of spines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Various recording techniques and spike separation methods are being used toward this goal. However, the error rates involved in spike separation have not yet been quantified. We studied the separation reliability of {\textquotedblleft}tetrode{\textquotedblright} (4-wire electrode)-recorded spikes by monitoring simultaneously from the same cell intracellularly with a glass pipette and extracellularly with a tetrode. With manual spike sorting, we found a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors, with errors typically ranging from 0 to 30\% depending on the amplitude and firing pattern of the cell, the similarity of the waveshapes of neighboring neurons, and the experience of the operator. Performance using only a single wire was markedly lower, indicating the advantages of multiple-site monitoring techniques over single-wire recordings. For tetrode recordings, error rates were increased by burst activity and during periods of cellular synchrony. The lowest possible separation error rates were estimated by a search for the best ellipsoidal cluster shape. Human operator performance was significantly below the estimated optimum. Investigation of error distributions indicated that suboptimal performance was caused by inability of the operators to mark cluster boundaries accurately in a high-dimensional feature space. We therefore hypothesized that automatic spike-sorting algorithms have the potential to significantly lower error rates. Implementation of a semi-automatic classification system confirms this suggestion, reducing errors close to the estimated optimum, in the range 0{\textendash}8\%.},

	abstract = {In the auditory cortex, synaptic inhibition is known to be involved in shaping receptive fields, enhancing temporal precision, and regulating gain. Cortical inhibition is provided by local GABAergic interneurons, which comprise 10{\textendash}20\% of the cortical population and can be separated into numerous subclasses. The morphological and physiological diversity of interneurons suggests that these different subclasses have unique roles in sound processing; however, these roles are yet unknown. Understanding the receptive field properties of distinct inhibitory cell types will be critical to elucidating their computational function in cortical circuits. Here we characterized the tuning and response properties of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, the largest inhibitory subclass. We used channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) as an optogenetic tag to identify PV+ and PV- neurons in vivo in transgenic mice. In contrast to PV+ neurons in mouse visual cortex, which are broadly tuned for orientation, we found that auditory cortical PV+ neurons were well tuned for frequency, although very tightly tuned PV+ cells were uncommon. This suggests that PV+ neurons play a minor role in shaping frequency tuning, and is consistent with the idea that PV+ neurons nonselectively pool input from the local network. PV+ interneurons had shallower response gain and were less intensity-tuned than PV- neurons, suggesting that PV+ neurons provide dynamic gain control and shape intensity tuning in auditory cortex. PV+ neurons also had markedly faster response latencies than PV- neurons, consistent with a computational role in enhancing the temporal precision of cortical responses.},

We performed whole cell patch recordings of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in rat somatosensory cortex slice while positioning a silicon probe in their vicinity to concurrently record intra- and extracellular voltages for spike frequencies under 20 Hz. We characterize biophysical events and properties (intracellular spiking, extracellular resistivity, temporal jitter, etc.) related to EAP recordings at the single-neuron level in a layer-specific manner. Notably, EAP amplitude was found to decay as the inverse of distance between the soma and the recording electrode with similar (but not identical) resistivity across layers. Furthermore, we assessed a number of EAP features and their variability with spike activity: amplitude (but not temporal) features varied substantially (\~{}30{\textendash}50\% compared with mean) and nonmonotonically as a function of spike frequency and spike order. Such EAP variation only partly reflects intracellular somatic spike variability and points to the plethora of processes contributing to the EAP. Also, we show that the shape of the EAP waveform is qualitatively similar to the negative of the temporal derivative to the intracellular somatic voltage, as expected from theory. Finally, we tested to what extent EAPs can impact the lowpass-filtered part of extracellular recordings, the local field potential (LFP), typically associated with synaptic activity. We found that spiking of excitatory neurons can significantly impact the LFP at frequencies as low as 20 Hz. Our results question the common assertion that the LFP acts as proxy for synaptic activity.},

	abstract = {The recurrent synaptic architecture of neocortex allows for self-generated network activity. One form of such activity is the Up state, in which neurons transiently receive barrages of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that depolarize many neurons to spike threshold before returning to a relatively quiescent Down state. The extent to which different cell types participate in Up states is still unclear. Inhibitory interneurons have particularly diverse intrinsic properties and synaptic connections with the local network, suggesting that different interneurons might play different roles in activated network states. We have studied the firing, subthreshold behavior, and synaptic conductances of identified cell types during Up and Down states in layers 5 and 2/3 in mouse barrel cortex in vitro. We recorded from pyramidal cells and interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), or neuropeptide Y. PV cells were the most active interneuron subtype during the Up state, yet the other subtypes also received substantial synaptic conductances and often generated spikes. In all cell types except PV cells, the beginning of the Up state was dominated by synaptic inhibition, which decreased thereafter; excitation was more persistent, suggesting that inhibition is not the dominant force in terminating Up states. Compared with barrel cortex, SOM and VIP cells were much less active in entorhinal cortex during Up states. Our results provide a measure of functional connectivity of various neuron types in barrel cortex and suggest differential roles for interneuron types in the generation and control of persistent network activity.},

We measured spike-related electrophysiological properties of identified corticospinal neurons in primary motor cortex slices from young adult mice. Several consistent features were observed in the suprathreshold responses to current steps: 1) Corticospinal neurons fired relatively fast action potentials (APs; width at half-maximum 0.65 {\textpm} 0.13 ms, mean {\textpm} standard deviation [SD]) compared with neighboring callosally projecting corticostriatal neurons. Corticospinal AP width was intermediate between 2 classes of inhibitory interneuron in layer 5B. Spike-to-spike variability in AP width and other spike waveform parameters was low, even during repetitive firing up to 20 Hz, that is, the relative narrowness of corticospinal APs was essentially frequency independent. 2) Frequency{\textendash}current (f{\textendash}I) relationships were nearly linear. 3) Trains of APs displayed regular firing, with rates typically staying constant or accelerating over time. Corticospinal neurons recorded from older mice (up to 4 months) or from a separate lateral cortical area (Region B; corresponding to secondary somatosensory cortex) showed generally similar intrinsic properties. Our findings have implications for interpreting spike waveforms of in vivo recorded neurons in the motor cortex. This analysis provides a framework for further biophysical and computational investigations of corticospinal neurons and their roles in motor cortical function.},

Furthermore, the functional interactions between cortical neurons are well documented but their spatial arrangement on the cortical surface has been largely ignored. Here we use a functional network analysis to demonstrate that a subset of motor cortical neurons in non-human primates spatially coordinate their spiking activity in a manner that closely matches wave propagation measured in the beta oscillatory band of the local field potential. We also demonstrate that sequential spiking of pairs of neuron contains task-relevant information that peaks when the neurons are spatially oriented along the wave axis. We hypothesize that the spatial anisotropy of spike patterning may reflect the underlying organization of motor cortex and may be a general property shared by other cortical areas.},

In layer V, the population of thick tufted PCs (TTCs) projects to subcortical targets such as the tectum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Another population of layer V PCs projects via the corpus callosum to the contralateral neocortical hemisphere mediating information transfer between the hemispheres. This subpopulation (corticocallosally projecting cells [CCPs]) has been previously described in terms of their morphological properties, but less is known about their electrophysiological properties, and their synaptic connectivity is unknown. We studied the morphological, electrophysiological, and synaptic properties of CCPs by retrograde labeling with fluorescent microbeads in P13-P16 Wistar rats. CCPs were characterized by shorter, untufted apical dendrites, which reached only up to layers II/III, confirming previous reports. Synaptic connections between CCPs were different from those observed between TTCs, both in probability of occurrence and dynamic properties. We found that the CCP network is about 4 times less interconnected than the TTC network and the probability of release is 24\% smaller, resulting in a more linear synaptic transmission. The study shows that layer V pyramidal neurons projecting to different targets form subnetworks with specialized connectivity profiles, in addition to the specialized morphological and electrophysiological intrinsic properties.},

The experimental data were derived from a large number of neurons throughout all layers. The majority of spikes were biphasic, with a dominant negative peak (mean amplitude, -0.11 mV), whereas a minority of APs had a dominant positive peak of +0.54-mV mean amplitude, with a maximum of +1.5 mV. The largest positive amplitude spikes were recorded in layer 5. The simulations demonstrated that a pyramidal neuron under known biophysical conditions may generate a negative peak with amplitude up to -1.5 mV, but that the amplitude of the positive peak may be at most 0.5 mV. We confirmed that spikes with large positive peaks were not produced by juxtacellular patch recordings. We conclude that there is a significant gap in our present understanding of either the spike-generation process in pyramidal neurons, the biophysics of extracellular recording, or both.},

Units with significant, short-latency ({\textless}3 ms) peaks following their action potentials in their cross-correlograms were characterized as putative excitatory (pyramidal) cells. Units with significant suppression of spiking of their partners were regarded as putative GABAergic interneurons. A portion of the putative interneurons was reciprocally connected with pyramidal cells. Neurons physiologically identified as inhibitory and excitatory cells were used as templates for classification of all recorded neurons. Of the several parameters tested, the duration of the unfiltered (1 Hz to 5 kHz) spike provided the most reliable clustering of the population.

Electrophysiological properties of neurons were assessed with intracellular recording techniques. Some neurons were identified morphologically by intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow CH. Three distinct neuronal classes of electrophysiological behavior were observed; these were termed regular spiking, bursting, and fast spiking. The physiological properties of neurons from sensorimotor and anterior cingulate areas did not differ significantly. Regular-spiking cells were characterized by action potentials with a mean duration of 0.80 ms at one-half amplitude, a ratio of maximum rate of spike rise to maximum rate of fall of 4.12, and a prominent afterhyperpolarization following a train of spikes. The primary slope of initial spike frequency versus injected current intensity was 241 Hz/nA. During prolonged suprathreshold current pulses the frequency of firing adapted strongly. When local synaptic pathways were activated, all cells were transiently excited and then strongly inhibited. Bursting cells were distinguished by their ability to generate endogenous, all-or-none bursts of three to five action potentials. Their properties were otherwise very similar to regular-spiking cells. The ability to generate a burst was eliminated when the membrane was depolarized to near the firing threshold with tonic current. By contrast, hyperpolarization of regular-spiking (i.e., nonbursting) cells did not uncover latent bursting tendencies. The action potentials of fast-spiking cells were much briefer (mean of 0.32 ms) than those of the other cell types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

A neuronal classification system is essential to organize such data and the knowledge that is derived from them. Classification depends on the unequivocal identification of the features that distinguish one type of neuron from another. The problems inherent in this are particularly acute when studying cortical interneurons. To tackle this, we convened a representative group of researchers to agree on a set of terms to describe the anatomical, physiological and molecular features of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex. The resulting terminology might provide a stepping stone towards a future classification of these complex and heterogeneous cells. Consistent adoption will be important for the success of such an initiative, and we also encourage the active involvement of the broader scientific community in the dynamic evolution of this project.},

	abstract = {Multichannel tetrode array recording in awake behaving animals provides a powerful method to record the activity of large numbers of neurons. The power of this method could be extended if further information concerning the intracellular state of the neurons could be extracted from the extracellularly recorded signals. Toward this end, we have simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular signals from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the anesthetized rat. We found that several intracellular parameters can be deduced from extracellular spike waveforms. The width of the intracellular action potential is defined precisely by distinct points on the extracellular spike. Amplitude changes of the intracellular action potential are reflected by changes in the amplitude of the initial negative phase of the extracellular spike, and these amplitude changes are dependent on the state of the network. In addition, intracellular recordings from dendrites with simultaneous extracellular recordings from the soma indicate that, on average, action potentials are initiated in the perisomatic region and propagate to the dendrites at 1.68 m/s. Finally we determined that a tetrode in hippocampal area CA1 theoretically should be able to record electrical signals from \~{}1,000 neurons. Of these, 60{\textendash}100 neurons should generate spikes of sufficient amplitude to be detectable from the noise and to allow for their separation using current spatial clustering methods. This theoretical maximum is in contrast to the approximately six units that are usually detected per tetrode. From this, we conclude that a large percentage of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells are silent in any given behavioral condition.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Principal_component_analysis&oldid=733253747},
	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.
PCA was invented in 1901 by Karl Pearson, as an analogue of the principal axis theorem in mechanics; it was later independently developed (and named) by Harold Hotelling in the 1930s. Depending on the field of application, it is also named the discrete Kosambi-Karhunen{\textendash}Lo{\`e}ve transform (KLT) in signal processing, the Hotelling transform in multivariate quality control, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in mechanical engineering, singular value decomposition (SVD) of X (Golub and Van Loan, 1983), eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of XTX in linear algebra, factor analysis (for a discussion of the differences between PCA and factor analysis see Ch. 7 of ), Eckart{\textendash}Young theorem (Harman, 1960), or Schmidt{\textendash}Mirsky theorem in psychometrics, empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) in meteorological science, empirical eigenfunction decomposition (Sirovich, 1987), empirical component analysis (Lorenz, 1956), quasiharmonic modes (Brooks et al., 1988), spectral decomposition in noise and vibration, and empirical modal analysis in structural dynamics.
PCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. PCA can be done by eigenvalue decomposition of a data covariance (or correlation) matrix or singular value decomposition of a data matrix, usually after mean centering (and normalizing or using Z-scores) the data matrix for each attribute. The results of a PCA are usually discussed in terms of component scores, sometimes called factor scores (the transformed variable values corresponding to a particular data point), and loadings (the weight by which each standardized original variable should be multiplied to get the component score).
PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses. Often, its operation can be thought of as revealing the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance in the data. If a multivariate dataset is visualised as a set of coordinates in a high-dimensional data space (1 axis per variable), PCA can supply the user with a lower-dimensional picture, a projection or "shadow" of this object when viewed from its (in some sense; see below) most informative viewpoint. This is done by using only the first few principal components so that the dimensionality of the transformed data is reduced.
PCA is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix.
PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset.},

Important concepts involved in the correct use and interpretation of this analysis, such as smooth and empirical ROC curves, parametric and nonparametric methods, the area under the ROC curve and its 95\% confidence interval, the sensitivity at a particular FPR, and the use of a partial area under the ROC curve are discussed. Various considerations concerning the collection of data in radiological ROC studies are briefly discussed.
