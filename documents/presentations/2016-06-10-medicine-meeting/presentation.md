# Classifying Neurons based On EAP:
Spike width was early reqocnized as a parameter that 
were different from interneurons and pyramidal neurons. 

# Motivation:
This will be a summary of what I have been working with the previous year
which will conclude in the deliver of my master thesis.
Shed light on a parameter that has been used for cell classification.

Electrode recordings provide the extracellular measurement of action potentials.

The ultimate goal, a database of spikes that can identify neurons based on
spike shape and location in the brain.

# Methods: Model of the cell membrane
* Show an image of membrane compartment.

# Compartmental Model
* Show an image of a neuron as compartments.

# Calculation of Extracellular Potential
* Show the equation for calculating extracelluar potentials.
The theory, compartmental models.
LFPy.

# Conservation of Current
* Show a model where current enter and leavs the compartments.

# Blue Brain Models
* Show the image of the blue brain article.
Models can be refitted to calculate extracellular potentials.

# Blue Brain Model Classes
* Show the types of models.

# Results: Running a simulation
* Show spikes around the soma. See how they are different.

# Spike Variability
* Show many sources of spike variability.
Even though there are many sources for variability, we try to 
calculate spike width and amplitude.

# Imitating Placement of Electrodes
* Show image of random placement of electrodes.

# Spike Width Definition
* Show an image with spike definitions used.

# Effect of Spike Width Definition
* Show how the definitions effect overlap.
Mention that the coefficient of variation matters. 
Peak-to-peak in itself is a measure with less variability.

# Spike Amplitude Definition

# Effects of Spike Amplitude Definition.
* Show same with amplitude.
Peak-to-peak good.

# Neuronal Classification
* Results from different kinds of neurons.

# Conclusion
The use of models opens up many possibilities of the analysis of EAP.

The best results: Spike width can be used to identify different neurons and amplitude.
Many models can be run to look at differences between neurons.
