% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.
\begin{frame}{Goals}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can spike width and amplitude be used to classify interneurons from
            pyramidal neurons.
        \item Which spike width and amplitude definition are better suited for classifying.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Blue Brain Models}
    % L5 P14 male Wistar Han rats. Seperated into morphological and 
    % electrophysiological types
    % I am using models from the blue brain team. Who are they, where are they. 
    % What rats, which area. L5 because of lots of research there.

    Simulation using the SphereRand class.

\begin{frame}{Amplitude from Soma}
    % Introduce the models, why they were chosen. Not very interesting.
    % What is a good definition? The seperation is good, but for all distances.
    % Heavy overlap for inhib types. But good seperation between the types.
    % Points closer to soma has fewer samples.

\begin{frame}{Width from Soma}

    % Peak to peak has better variance compared

\begin{frame}{Combined Width and Amplitude}
    % Variation in interneurons are much bigger than with the pyramidal models.
    % Might be because of the models, not sure if this is a feature of the models or 
    % the neurons.

\begin{frame}{Comparing Width Definitions}
    Other remarks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Baseline is not always well defined.
        \item Peak-to-peak more resistant to noise.
        \item Half width requires high temporal resolution.
        \item Widths seem a bit long compared to other experimental results.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{}
    Summary:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Amplitude should be considered when classifying based on width.
        \item Can use this simulation environment with new models for future 
            research.
    \end{itemize}
    % Remarks:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item Width was not used by blue brain, inter spike interval more commonly used recently.
    % \end{itemize}
