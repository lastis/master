# Blue Brain Simulations
Simulations using models from the blue brain project.

* `sim_00.py` : Spike width and amp data.
* `sim_01.py` : More simulations than `sim_00.py`. Gives many plots.
* `sim_02.py` : Plots spike width and amp from previously simulated neurons.
                Uses `sim_00.py` data.
